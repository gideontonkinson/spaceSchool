                    Our teachers love space and they love to teach about how to live here to their students. Our faculty is small
                    but that combine with our small amount of students allows for a strong bond between them and students. That bond
                    is needed and teaches trust and the need to rely on others in the depths of space where they are planning on going.
                    <br>
                    A variety of classe are offered here: Space Flight Training, Chemisty, Mechanical Engineering, Strength Training (required 
                    every semester because of the moons reduced gravity), Moon History, Space History, Computer Science, World History, Botany, English, Nutrition,
                    Medical Training, Calculus, Physics, Stratigic Thinking and Analyzing the Accuracy of Space Films.
                    <br>
                    Each of these classes helps to round out students to be ready to advance into the unknown. Students also can ephasize and 
                    speak to their professor about what ephasizing in a certain aspect of space exploration would entail.
