                        Ryan Cabootee is one of the greatest minds of our age. He is the founder of the Musk School of Space
                        and lead the team that set up Moon Base Alpha. He was a top engineer at Virgin Galctic, but left to start a 
                        robotics and AI company now known as Robot Inc. Ryan is passionate about space and its exploration. He also loves
                        to share knowledge and is an active part of teaching students.

                        Anastasia Teleteshanko is tough as nails due to being raised in Russia, but she does have soft spot
                        for helping her students reach their full potential. Before teaching she took lead on making sure that 
                        citizen of Moon Base Alpha could grow food, had proper nutrition and could recieve top notch medical care.
                        She hopes that what she does now can help her students discover that while space is incredible, so is dirt and 
                        the human body.

                        and he is currently working with stuents to create a wormhole splicer.

                        excel in classes and one day hopefully learn alien languages.
